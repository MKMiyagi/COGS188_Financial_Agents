    "\n",
    "Stock trading is full of unpredictability and volatility. Without substantial understanding and experience in trading stocks, it is difficult for a person to trade actively and profit off of stocks. However, mathematical models and intelligent software can do a much better job of learning patterns and capitalizing on them. We explore the performance of value-based and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms on trading stock data by comparing profits earned by Monte Carlo Q-learning, Monte Carlo policy gradient, and Advantage Actor-Critic on AAPL, TSLA, META, NVDA, and GME stocks from 2014 to 2024."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock market is a highly dynamic environment influenced by various factors, making it challenging to develop reliable trading strategies. Traditional rule-based approaches are often too rigid and fail to adapt to changing market conditions. Recently, machine learning techniques, particularly **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, have become a popular tool for financial applications due to their ability to learn optimal strategies through direct interaction with the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to build a **stock market trading agent** that leverages **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)** as the underlying framework and applies **Q-Learning** and **Monte Carlo methods** to learn an optimal trading policy. The agent will use historical stock price data to simulate trading decisions and learn when to buy, sell, or hold a stock to maximize long-term profitability. We will focus on backtesting the agent’s strategy on historical data to assess its performance in a simulated environment.\n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to design a stock market trading agent that interacts with historical stock data and learns to optimize its trading strategy using **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**. The problem can be modeled as an MDP with the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Space:** The state provides information on stock prices over the past `window_size` days.\n",
    "- **Action Space:** The agent can choose one of three actions at each time step:\n",
    "  - **Buy:** Purchase some quantity of the stock.\n",
    "  - **Sell:** Sell some quantity of held stocks.\n",
    "  - **Hold:** Take no action and maintain the current position.\n",
    "- **Reward Function:** The reward function rewards the agent for making profitable actions on each stock:\n",
    "  - **Buy:** +5 reward for a valid purchase (based on agent's balance), +2 if agent overestimates number of stocks it can purchase, -5 reward if agent does not have enough money to even purchase one stock\n",
    "  - **Sell:** +5 for a sell that increases the agent's total portfolio value, -2 if agent loses porfolio value after selling, and -5 for an invalid sell action\n",
    "  - **Hold:** No reward or penalty\n",
    "  - **Bonus:** Percentage change in portfolio value * 10\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train the agent using three reinforcement learning approaches:\n",
    "1. **Monte Carlo Q-Learning** a model-free method that learns the optimal action at each state.\n",
    "2. **Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)** a policy-based on-policy method that simulates entire processes and updates the policy according to the final reward.\n",
    "3. **A2C** an improvement on REINFORCE that introduces an actor-critic architecture where the actor learns the policy while the critic estimates the value function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate the performance of each agent by looking at the final portfoliio value at the end of the time period. At the same time, we will be comparing their performance against that of the S&P500 across the same period."

    "### Interpreting the result\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, you've given us quite a bit of tech informaiton above, now its time to tell us what to pay attention to in all that.  Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there any problems with the work?  For instance would more data change the nature of the problem? Would it be good to explore more hyperparams than you had time for?   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future work\n",
    "Looking at the limitations and/or the toughest parts of the problem and/or the situations where the algorithm(s) did the worst... is there something you'd like to try to make these better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "If your project has obvious potential concerns with ethics or data privacy discuss that here.  Almost every ML project put into production can have ethical implications if you use your imagination. Use your imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you can't come up with an obvious ethical concern that should be addressed, you should know that a large number of ML projects that go into producation have unintended consequences and ethical problems once in production. How will your team address these issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a tool to help you address the potential issues such as https://deon.drivendata.org\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."
