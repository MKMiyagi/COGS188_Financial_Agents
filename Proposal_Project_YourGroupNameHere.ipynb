    "\n",
    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the _other_ proposal for that. This is the proposal description for (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your AI system. Generally RL tasks may require a huge amount of training, so extensive grid search is unlikely to be possible. However expoloring a few reasonable hyper-parameters may still be possible. \n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your AI system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock market is a highly dynamic environment influenced by various factors, making it challenging to develop reliable trading strategies. Traditional rule-based approaches are often too rigid and fail to adapt to changing market conditions. Recently, machine learning techniques, particularly **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, have become a popular tool for financial applications due to their ability to learn optimal strategies through direct interaction with the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to build a **stock market trading agent** that leverages **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)** as the underlying framework and applies **Q-Learning** and **Monte Carlo methods** to learn an optimal trading policy. The agent will use historical stock price data to simulate trading decisions and learn when to buy, sell, or hold a stock to maximize long-term profitability. We will focus on backtesting the agent’s strategy on historical data to assess its performance in a simulated environment.\n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to design a stock market trading agent that interacts with historical stock data and learns to optimize its trading strategy using **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**. The problem can be modeled as an MDP with the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Space:** The state represents market conditions, derived from technical indicators such as recent price movements, moving averages, and volatility measures.\n",
    "- **Action Space:** The agent can choose one of three actions at each time step:\n",
    "  - **Buy:** Purchase a fixed quantity of the stock.\n",
    "  - **Sell:** Sell the currently held stock.\n",
    "  - **Hold:** Take no action and maintain the current position.\n",
    "- **Reward Function:** The reward at each step is the change in the portfolio value after taking an action, incentivizing profitable trades while penalizing losses or excessive trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train the agent using two reinforcement learning approaches:\n",
    "1. **Monte Carlo Methods** for episodic policy evaluation and learning from full episodes of simulated trading.\n",
    "2. **Q-Learning**, a model-free method, to improve the agent’s strategy by updating Q-values for each state-action pair through iterative exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance will be evaluated using key metrics, including cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.\n"
