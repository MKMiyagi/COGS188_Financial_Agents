    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the _other_ proposal for that. This is the proposal description for (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your AI system. Generally RL tasks may require a huge amount of training, so extensive grid search is unlikely to be possible. However expoloring a few reasonable hyper-parameters may still be possible. \n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your AI system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

The dataset stores key features such as Opening Price, Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Trading Volume, and Date which are measured daily. First we will prepare the data by cleaning missing values and normalizing key features to ensure consistency. Then the data we will train an agent to buy, sell, or hold decisions based on past market trends utilizing reinforcement learning algorithm such as Q-Learning and Monte-Carlo Simulations. The performance of the agent will be evaulated using ..."

With two different reinforcement learning approaches, we will evaluate how each trained agent behave differently.

While we are not considering another model as a benchmark, we will benchmark our agents with historical averages of the S&P 500.\n",

    "Developing a stock trading agent raises several ethical and privacy concerns, particularly in fairness, transparency, and security. The first concern is Market Fairness because algorithmic trading has the possiblity to contirbute to market manipulation, flash crashes, and unfair trading advantages for those with more computational resources. Furthermore, high-frequency trading firms already exploit the small inefficiencies that cannot be done by human traders. The next concern is that training models on historical data must be done cautiously to avoid overfitting to past trends which could mislead users into making bad financial decisions. Ensuring a transparent and interpretable agent is crucial because black-box reinforcement learning models can make unpredictable trades. Lastly, the societal impact should be considered because automated trading can influence the price of stocks and exacerbate market volatility and systematic risks. Making sure that there are safeguards within the agent if it is deployed at scale is necessary to prevent market spikes and crashes. "
